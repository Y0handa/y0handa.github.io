Starting to feel unworthy to be a programmer and always confused with the errors encountered.Until now I still feel the same way when an error occurs, it always feels curious that the error hasn’t disappeared. Maybe someone has experienced what I experienced too.And of course my feelings will be very happy if the error message changes even though the error is really not fixed. but at least I have been struggling to resolve the error and this is where I usually start using stackoverflow, google and the community is very helpful (most often to the coding school forum hahaha).Many developers say that if we have to think of an error as a friend, when we meet him it means we will have new experiences, we will learn new things. The spirit in the face of errors that exist, all can certainly be resolved.remember, it is not only you &amp; erroe that has been experienced by other people too (believe me).Okay maybe that’s all this article, thank you for reading.Happy coding!"},{"title":"Hello World","url":"/2020/07/24/hello-world/","content":"Welcome to Hexo!
